 `InteractablePhysicsComponent` is a component that has both geometry and a physics body.  It can be manipulated as it conforms to 'PhysicsEventComponentProtocol'.
 
 This class also conforms to copyWithZone:, and it creates deep copies with new geometries and materials. Don't make a lot of copies or you'll hurt performance.
