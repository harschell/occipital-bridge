 `BridgeControllerManipulationComponent` is a component that manages the
 identifying and manipulating of objects that follow the
 'PhysicsEventComponentProtocol'.
 
 You are required to register as a delegate to BEController and pass button, motion transform, and trackpad events through this component for it to function.
 
 @warning When you call the start command, this component will look for the existence of the 'BridgeControllerComponenet' and the 'InputBeamComponent' on its entity and throw an assert if they are not found.
