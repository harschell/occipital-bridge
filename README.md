# Welcome to the Bridge Engine Beta 3!

We're glad to have you onboard. We're committed to enhancing Bridge Engine, so we take all of your feedback and support very earnestly.

#### New in Beta 3: Bridge Headset Support & Rendering Overhaul
- It turns out we were working on a whole headset to go along with Bridge Engine! Learn more at the [Bridge website](https://bridge.occipital.com)
- Full-resolution rendering - critical for VR
- Forward rendering pipeline. This means compositing onto a global depth buffer with the room geometry, with all SceneKit material controls available like depth testing, rendering order and blending modes.

#### Much More is on the Way
We'll soon release a Bridge Engine open source library containing Bridget's core functions like path planning, animation and scripting, as well as additional UI components, audio, and general mixed reality tools to help you develop with Bridge Engine.
We'll also be creating additional materials like video tutorials and more documentation.

#### Get Involved
Want to help us expand the capabilities of Bridge Engine? We'd love contributions in the form of pull requests. Soon, we will formalize how to best contribute to Bridge Engine, but feel free to contact us and get involved here on Github.
