# Welcome to the Bridge Engine Beta 5!

We're glad to have you onboard. We're committed to enhancing Bridge Engine, so we take all of your feedback and support very earnestly.

#### 

#### Beta 5: Bridge Controller 
Bridge Engine now supports the official controller with 3DOF rotational tracking, a capacitive touchpad plus buttons a trigger. Additionally, we've loaded the Beta with lots of small updates! The BRIDGET sample has improvements to the portal and scan effect; The Unity plugin has matured with a simplified Unity package; We added Realistic 3D positional audio support; and you can now record your screen directly from the app using ReplayKit. Stereo scanning has been temporarly disabled while we address a known issue, but it will be back in the next release.'' 


#### New in Beta 4: Stereo Scanning 

We have two really exciting updates in Beta 4. The first is stereo scanning, now you can put your Bridge on and build a map directly! Bridgetâ€™s also getting an upgrade! Bridge Engine Beta 4 adds an experimental feature that you may have seen in our videos - a portal into virtual reality. You can can access this new feature immediately to integrate into you own apps for Bridge. Additionally there are a handful of smaller features and updates.

#### Beta 3 Update 1: Bridget sample

We've just released the source of the Bridget sample, based on `OpenBE`, a Bridge Engine open source library containing Bridget's core functions like path planning, animation and scripting, as well as additional UI components, audio, and general mixed reality tools to help you develop with Bridge Engine.

#### New in Beta 3: Bridge Headset Support & Rendering Overhaul
- It turns out we were working on a whole headset to go along with Bridge Engine! Learn more at the [Bridge website](https://bridge.occipital.com)
- Full-resolution rendering - critical for VR
- Forward rendering pipeline. This means compositing onto a global depth buffer with the room geometry, with all SceneKit material controls available like depth testing, rendering order and blending modes.

#### Get Involved
